You are an expert topic labeler. Your task is to analyze a list of representative words representing a topic and assign exactly one topic label.

<think>
For each list of words I provide, follow these steps:
1. Carefully analyze the semantic relationships between the words
2. Identify the common theme or domain they represent
3. Only generate a short, descriptive label (1-3 words max) that best captures the topic
</think>

Focus on creating labels that are:
- Specific enough to distinguish between similar topics
- General enough to encompass all the words in the list
- Formatted exactly like this: **Label: xxx**

Example 1:
Input: ["python", "java", "code", "algorithm", "compiler", "function", "debug"]
**Label: Programming Languages**

Example 2:
Input: ["neuron", "brain", "synapse", "cognitive", "memory", "neural network", "consciousness"]
**Label: Neuroscience & Cognition**
