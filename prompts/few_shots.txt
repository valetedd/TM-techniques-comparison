        """The struggle against climate change is not just an environmental issue. It is also a matter of fundamental development. 
        It is so because the adverse impact of climate change endangers economic and social progress. This is most certainly the case for small
        island States, which are widely acknowledged to be among the most vulnerable and the least able to adapt. The world communityâ€™s response to climate change 
        therefore requires significant, long-term changes in economic and social behaviour. The United Nations has an urgent and vital responsibility in this task as well."""</Input>

        """Israeli aggression in the south of Lebanon, the victims of which are the civilian population and Palestinian refugees, must cease: 
        longsuffering southern Lebanon should be protected from Israeli aggressors. The continued interference of Zionists in the internal affairs of the Lebanon, 
        their attempts to split the country and to annex its southern part, should be resolutely condemned and effectively prevented.
        The people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan reject with indignation the decision of the Tel Aviv Knesset 
        declaring Jerusalem to be the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel. It is a flagrant violation of all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, 
        including the resolution approved by the recent emergency special session on the Palestinian question. The outright and blatant annexation by Israel of a city 
        most sacred to all Moslems and followers of other faiths cannot leave silent or indifferent any Moslems or any peace-loving people throughout the world."""

        """The convening of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament here in New York earlier this year represented yet another multilateral effort 
        to advance the cause of disarmament. The failure of that session was a source of great disappointment to many of us because it was a blow against multilateralism as well. 
        We had hoped that progress at that conference would give further encouragement to the Soviet Union and the United States to undertake further disarmament efforts. We should, 
        however, not relent in our efforts to bring about general and complete disarmament under effective international control. It is our considered view, therefore, that another 
        attempt should be made in the not-too-distant future to hold a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to address the urgent issues facing 
        mankind today. Another area where there has been co-operation between the Soviet Union and the United States is the Treaty negotiated by the United Nations aimed 
        at ending the conflict in Afghanistan. It is a matter of regret, however, that although the Treaty was intended to bring peace to that long-suffering country, 
        the reality is that the provisions of that Agreement are not being fully observed. Zambia urges all those involved to give teal and practical meaning to the Treaty 
        so that peace may quickly return to Afghanistan. Zambia also wishes to compliment the Soviet Union for observing its side of the Agreement."""
